    title: '3 Things to Consider when Including Basement in Residential Build',

          <p>
            The way your lot, or land, lays between your property lines is a very important item to consider when dealing with basements.  How much dirt will have to be moved or brought in to achieve your goal?  Does the land naturally slope away from your basement, increasing your likelihood of a dry basement and any leaks from forming.  Are you craving a walk out basement?  Certain lot layouts tend to be easier to deal with walk out basements but any land can be made into a walk up basement.  Decide how your new house will fit on your property and start the design from there.  Basements are a great investment and provided additional square footage for whatever you are wanting and needing in additional space.

          <h2 id="egress-from-basement">Egress from basement</h2>
          <p>
            Along with additional square footage, you may decide to turn the space in the basement into bedrooms.  In some states, to be considered a bedroom, one will need to means of egress from the room and a closet.  One egress would be windows that must be within 36” of the basement floor and wide enough for a fully dressed firefighter to enter and exit that particular space.  The other egress would simply be the door to the bedroom.  If you are wanting more bedrooms and want to place them in the basement, make sure to check with your local planning and zoning for exact requirements.

          <h2 id="pre-plumbing">Pre-plumbing</h2>
          <p>
            Before the concrete floor is poured in your basement you may want to consider pre plumbing for a bathroom or kitchenette for future expansion.  Preparing for this down the line will prevent an awful mess of jacking up concrete and installing plumbing.  It will actually be cheaper to plan ahead.

            Being able to choose between hardwood floors and the newly, and ever evolving, composite floors can save a heap of money on the bottom line.  Still want hardwood?  Go to a local hardwood store and find something you love.  Get online and look for discount warehouses and do some online shopping.  Countertops are another area that simply shopping around for the best prices could potentially save another mound of money.  From formica to engineered stones, you will have to decide which one that you prefer. Appliances in the kitchen can save money by simply picking normal sized refrigerators over counter depth.  Or electric stoves and ovens over gas fueled ones.  Appliance options that could save even more is purchasing around a holiday event that offers deeper discounts.

            Of course you want the outside of your house to be beautiful.  However, there are products coming out on the market every single day that are new and innovative.  Brick and stone work will be the most expensive.  But there are attractive vinyls and even lifetime products that are easy to install that are a fraction of the price.  Roofing materials can also range in price.  Asphalt shingles being the least expensive option while metal (standing seam vs barn metal) can be a touch higher along with higher installation costs.

          <h2 id="concrete-vs-wood">Concrete vs Wood</h2>
          <p>
            Watch out when pouring all that concrete.  Concrete patios can be switched out for traditional decking material made out of pressure treated wood and will save you tons!  Also, composite decking material will be almost 5x as much as a pressure treated deck.

          <h2 id="finished-vs-unfinished-basements">Finished vs Unfinished Basements</h2>
          <p>
            Eliminating finishing this area can be a huge difference when thinking about $85-$110 per square foot to finish.

            Concrete as a material is expensive but forming 10’ walls over the standard 8’ wall will also add to the bottom line of the budget.  Get a few extra inches of headroom by triple plating the seal plate with some lumber, which is less expensive than concrete.

    title: 'What is up with all the “Green” houses?',
    summary: 'The title may have been a little misleading.  This article is not about how to reduce your carbon footprint with your house but rather it’s about the actual color, “green.”  These actually green colored boards are called ZIP system boards and are being placed over the framing of the house that has been traditional OSB board and Tyvek weather wrap.',

            ZIP is an interesting concept that takes all the traditional building sheathing and incorporates it into a neater, quicker design.  The boards are actually waterproof with an air barrier built in.  No more house wrap!  No more extra holes being nailed into your sheathing to hold the house wrap on.  What about the seams?  They have that covered too!  They have two options.  One is a tape that is weatherproof and extremely easy to apply.  Just tape your seams and then use a roller to embed it and you are done.  Window flashings are the same way.  Use the tape and make a water tight air barrier around your house!  Their second option is a liquid flashing that you can smooth over the seams with a trowel and also cover the nail holes used to place the board in place on the framing.

            One of the overlooked aspects of this material is that is guaranteed not to warp or crack when left out in the elements.  Can’t get to sheathing for a couple of months, it is perfectly fine to be left out in the elements for up to 6 months.  Try doing that with OSB or plywood sheathing!
          </p>

          <p>
            They also have a product called ZIP-R.  These are insulated panels.  Breaking the thermal barrier by placing insulation between the sheathing and the framing.  Framing allows hot and cold temperatures to infiltrate the house when it is directly laying against the framing.  But ZIP-R prevents energy za

          <p>
            In the competitive world of construction, not only will this save you on installation time, it will build a superior product to the old fashioned way of sheathing your house.  Look into it and do some research.  As for price, ZIP has close to $3000 back in rebates to offset the costs!
          </p>

          <p>
            Technology advancements are all around us and being uninformed about new products will only hinder the growth of your construction company.  Look into the ZIP system and see what it all has to offer.
