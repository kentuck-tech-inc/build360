# Virtual floorplan customization
A user should be able to view a floorplan in virtual reality
and customize the materials of the walls and floors

## User flow
- User starts in the center of the largest room
  - *how do we calculate this for concave rooms?*
    - maybe use a smaller convex sub-section
- User interacts with a customizable element (floor, wall, ect)
- User is provide with a menu with a grid of customization options
- User selects an option
- Option is applied to the customizable element
- When user has finished customizing, they can share the customized plan
  - How do they access this feature?
    - Need a main menu that we can save / share from
    - Can view estimated cost
- Using the customization options, and the area of the surfaces they are applied to,
  a price estimate can be generated.
